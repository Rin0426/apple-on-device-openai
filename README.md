```

You can access the API at `http://localhost:3000` by default. Make sure to adjust the port as needed.

### Example API Call

Here’s how you can make a request to the API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/generate \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"prompt": "What is the future of AI?"}'
```

## 🛠️ Configuration

You can configure the server settings in the `config.json` file. Here are some of the key settings:

- **port**: The port on which the server will run.
- **model**: Specify the model you want to use.
- **maxTokens**: Set the maximum number of tokens for the response.
